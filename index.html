<strong>Frozen Lake</strong>
Treading on a frozen lake,

We avoid looking deep down

Afraid to watch beneath the surface

Worrying that it will crack



Afraid to come to terms

with this creepy truth

too tricky … too fast

Too unstable!



For we can connect

But we’re not in touch

Not really in touch

For we can connect

But we’re not awake

Not truly awake

For we can connect

But we’re growing apart

So far apart



Tramping on an ice sheet

We can only run fast

There’s no other way out

Over-whelming as it is



Afraid to come to terms

with this creepy truth

too tricky … too fast

Too unstable!



Stepping over ice

The wind’s gonna change

it will soon crack open

Stepping over ice

The wind’s gonna change

it will soon crack open



Fake freedom
Fake freedom

we need constraints

Fake freedom

We get new chains

Fake freedom

In our frames

Fake freedom

In our brains



Fake freedom

In spoken words

Fake freedom

In our thoughts

Fake freedom

In our picks

Fake freedom

In our fears



Ransom 

Ransom 



Fake…



You want to be safe

You cannot be free

You want to be comfy

Give up on yourself

Fake Freedom, fake freedom

Fake Freedom, fake freedom



<strong>Weight</strong>
How weird to feel

I’m making no difference

Carrying the weight,

yet feeling so weightless



How strange to realize

That wind gusts in time

Might sweep me away

Like leaves on my way



Just an accessory

No grip on reality

I’m but a puppet

pulled by a stranger



Why strive to fight back?

My saying is trash

No shots (for me) to call

All games are rigged now



I’m carrying the weight

Yet floating like feathers

I hope that the winds

Show mercy on me



Just an accessory

No grip on reality

Just an accessory

No grip on reality



weightless



<strong>Orpheus</strong>
Don’t you turn back!

Don’t you turn back, Orpheus

Never look back

Never look back Orpheus

Don’t seek for safety

Or even belonging either

Just walk alone

With your heart light and empty



When love is risk, it turns into life

When love is safe, it blows out the light

Keep all your fortitude

Up to life

Keep the pact with whimsical gods

Don’t ask for possessions



Time is your key

Give her the time to walk to the light

Walk on her path

And drive her with your sweet song



Don’t you turn back!

Don’t you turn back, Orpheus

Never look back

Never look back Orpheus



<strong>Anima Mundi</strong>
An eye for an eye

A tooth for a tooth

We can do better

Wanna trade?



All cards on the table

a grin for a fake smile

Bitterness for brags

Regret for firm belief

Compassion for duplicity



So many fake their perfect lives

Too many stage their flimsy vision

Can take it no more

Will bear it no more

Our world rotten to the core

Its soul shredded to the bone

The lucky few

thrive,

deceive,

hoard

and cherish

Forsaken multitudes

run,

endure,

starve,

and perish



Moral compass flushed down the drain

Hypocrisy beyond redemption

All hope betrayed

Shameless, hopeless, merciless

Poor little things wandering about

Oh, what pitiful creatures we are

As the soul of our world withers and dies

We keep on keeping the Parade going

We’re past the end of it all



Fact is, nobody told us

Fact is, nobody told us

Fact is, nobody told us



<strong>Perception</strong>
Just a perception

A tedious sensation

We’re drifting away, awaiting disaster



Viruses and antibodies

They seem to work fine

We’re drifting away, awaiting disaster



Unconscious awareness

Unaware consciousness

We’re drifting away, awaiting disaster



Unable to see

Unwilling to hear

We’re drifting away, awaiting disaster



Unable to avoid it

Unwilling to listen

We’re drifting away, awaiting disaster



It’s happening now



<strong>Behind the line</strong>
You’re sure we need it



Are you sure we need the brontobyte?

Are you sure we need the chip inside?

Are you sure we need to improve machines?

Are you sure we need to increase the waste?



Look, the means become the end

but the end is not the need

Look, the means become the end

but the end is not the need



Above our heads we cannot control, we cannot control

Above our heads we cannot control, we cannot control



Are you sure we need, anti-age?

Are you sure we need more medicines?

Are you sure we need to maximize?

Are you sure we need to minimize?



Who is going to rule and guide?

Can someone reverse the tide?

Who is going to rule and guide?

Can someone reverse the tide?



Should we stay behind the line?

Should we stay behind the line?



Above our heads we cannot control, we cannot

control ….



<strong>Running circles</strong>
Keep running circles

Keep taking chances

Hamsters in wheels, ain’t that right?

Wasting emotions

Having not had a

good dream in a year



Mesmerized by lights

In the underground

Lost in the echoes

Of a blues band sound

We keep on treading

The worn boards of our lives

Stupidly buying

The whole bunch of lies



all we can get now

all we can afford

running on empty,

running on empty 



Brain filled with noises

Outliers and voices

So hard to keep them

at bay all the time



Two by three box

That’s where I spend

Most of my day

I miss my horizon

I need to breathe fresh air

Empty my head, turn inward



Things will be looking up

And we’ll all be safe

It’s maybe a delusion

But it’s all we are left

Wish I could tell you

That the worst is past

I’d rather shut up

And just let it go
